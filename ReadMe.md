[Broman KW (2012) Haplotype probabilities in advanced intercross lines. G3 2:199-202](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22384398)

The `Calculations/` directory contains a bunch of [maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net) code for the
main calculations in the paper plus R code to check the results.
There is some additional R code in there, for simulations to further
check the results, though this work is not mentioned in the paper.
